### Moving to Portugal was a dream fueled by a desire for a simpler life, a low cost of living, and year-round surfing. However, as it often does, life presented a series of revelations that prompted a shift in my perspective and plans. Below is an overview of the trip from NY to Portugal, reflections on the nation, and a glimpse into my next adventure

The seven-hour transatlantic flight from NY to Portugal is easy to tolerate, and being this close to my family and friends in the USA added to the allure of Portugal. Upon arrival in Europe, it is easy to get to where you need to be; Europeans travel frequently and have built a top-notch infrastructure to aid in that pursuit. You could fall asleep on the NY flight and enjoy breakfast at your destination eight hours later if you plan it right.

I traveled with Tap, Portugal's airline monopoly, which offers passable service with outdated airplanes. Notably, it's the only carrier that has canceled my flights twice because of strikes. Its website is rudimentary, barely surpassing the quality of my senior college web development project. Surprisingly, surfboards aren't listed as a distinct category for sports equipment luggage when booking. Consequently, I opted for standard checked baggage at $105, anticipating higher fees at the airport, which, fortunately, were not imposed. This experience offers a valuable tip for international surfers considering flying with Tap.

The Portuguese are often praised for their warmth, which may be true for most tourists. But as a dark-skinned Brazilian man considering relocating to their country, my experiences were mixed, with a noticeable chill from many locals—unless a transaction was involved. While it's a common jest among Brazilians to poke fun at the Portuguese for being less than bright, my encounters, especially in service-oriented situations like government offices, dental appointments, car purchases, and dining out, often reinforced this stereotype. The Portuguese women I met were dull and unattractive, failing to leave a lasting impression on me. However, hope lingered as I attempted to persuade my retired father to relocate to Portugal. His agreement could have expedited our paperwork process, and having his and his wife's company would have given me the sense of community I found lacking. Feeling welcomed and at ease in a new country is crucial for any long-term move. The unexpected sentiment of not being welcomed here was pivotal in my decision-making process.

Simultaneously, an alternative emerged that I hadn't considered before: Morocco. Known for its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and, importantly, its exceptional surfing conditions, Morocco also boasts a lower cost of living than Portugal. This revelation was a game-changer. The idea of exploring Moroccan culture, coupled with the opportunity to indulge in some of the world's best surf spots, seemed like an unexpected but welcome twist in my journey.

This shift in destination, however, sparked a broader realization. The world is vast, filled with undiscovered opportunities and experiences. Why limit myself to settling in one place when there are so many cultures to experience, waves to surf, and lessons to learn? This epiphany has led me to embrace becoming a global nomad (at least for a while).

In conclusion, while Portugal was the initial dream, it served as a stepping stone towards a larger vision. I now find myself excited at the prospect of traveling the world to find other places to fall in love with. Each destination promises new adventures, surfing experiences, and the chance to immerse myself in different cultures. Portugal and Morocco are just the beginning. The true journey lies in exploring the unknown, embracing change, and the endless quest for a place—or perhaps places—that feel like home.
