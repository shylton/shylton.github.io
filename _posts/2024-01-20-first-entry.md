### Dreams are nothing but smoke until you choose to take action and bring them to life. In pursuit of mine, I've decided to embark on a global adventure, armed with two surfboards and a laptop. My plan is simple: starting in New York, I will journey eastward, circling the globe, until I return to my starting point from the west. Along the way, I'll immerse myself in the world's most renowned surfing destinations, spending at least one month in each to truly connect with the local waves and culture.

### Planning

I present here a potential route.

**Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ ->** This must be the first stop on my journey. Last year, enamored with Portugal, I flirted with the idea of moving there. Obviously, the first step after you initially think about moving somewhere is to buy a car there, which I did. But now, with my plans having taken a different turn, I need to return to Porto not only to sell the car but also to sort out a few other lingering matters.

**Imsouane ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ ->** I was there in November and December of last year before coming back to NY for Christmas, New Years, and my nephewâ€™s birthday. The people and culture of Morocco fascinated me. I made a few Muslim friends and decided to observe the monthlong Ramadan, which starts March 10, with them. Inshallah I will get there by the first week of March and stay up to three months. Then I'll likely embark on the six-hour road trip from Imsouane to Casablanca before the next leg of my journey. This presents a fantastic opportunity to witness the edge of the Sahara Desert and explore some lesser-known surf spots in the Northern Moroccan coast. Once in Casablanca, I'll face a choice: either fly directly to Dubai or head south into the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Luanda ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡´ ->** Angola is rumored to be one of the few remaining countries offering excellent, uncrowded surf spots. However, its accessibility has historically been challenging. Until recently, the high cost and difficulty of travel, including strict visa requirements, crime concerns, and poor infrastructure, have deterred many. I've heard that the visa requirements might have eased now, which is promising. As a Brazilian, I'm also comforted by the fact that Portuguese is Angola's main language. Moreover, my interactions with Angolans have always been exceptionally positive; they're cool people.

**Jeffreys Bay ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ ->** Very Popular surfing destination.

**Bali ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© ->** Ultra popular surfing destination.

**Sydney/Gold Coast ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º ->** Extremely popular surfing destinations.

**Polynesia ðŸ‡µðŸ‡« ->** Another popular surfing destination.

**Auckland ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ ->** Apparently the flights from here to Hawaii are cheaper, as if I needed an excuse to visit New Zealand.

**Oahu ðŸŒº ->** aka Paradise. Currently my favorite place in the world, I wonder if that opinion will have changed by the time I get back there.

**California ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ->** Probably towards the South, San Diego or Santa Barbara. I will fly back home to New York from here Inshallah.

My plan is to travel alone, meeting people and updating this blog. Notice that I did not include any time tables. Flight prices and level of fun will dictate my timing.

I am fortunate to have a curious mind that has led me to explore many fascinating places around the world. Recently, this curiosity has been complemented by the privilege of being able to work from anywhere, provided there's a reliable internet connection. My plans to travel the globe in 2024 represent the pinnacle of these achievements. I eagerly anticipate encountering diverse cultures, learning new languages, and embracing the challenges that will inevitably arise. To those reading this: consider yourselves invited to join me on this journey. Your feedback and insights are not just welcome, but eagerly awaited.
