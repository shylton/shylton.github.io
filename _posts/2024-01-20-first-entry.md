### Dreams are just smoke until you make a decision to act, so I decided to travel around the world with my surfboards. The plan is simple, I will fly Eastward from New York, keep flying around the globe until reaching my starting point from the West, and I will stay for at least one month in popular surfing destinations along the way.

Planning
---
[include map with points and arrow]
As of now, here are the cities I wish to visit.

**Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ ->** This must be the first stop. Last year I thought about moving to Portugal and, as everyone knows, the first thing you should do when you have the idea to move someplace new is buy a car there. Well, I changed my mind so now I have to go back and sell the car and figure out what to do with a few other things that are there.

**Imsouane ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ ->** Another must-do spot, and the last one. I was there for about 5 weeks in December when I came to NY to celebrate Christmas, New Years, and my nephewâ€™s birthday. The people and culture of Morocco are fascinating and Iâ€™d like to observe the monthlong Ramadan, which starts March 10, with them. I hope to get there in the first week of March Insha Allah.

**Luanda ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡´ ->** Angola is allegedly one of the last few countries that can provide good UNCROWDED surf. There may be reasons for that, up until recently getting there was expensive and difficult. There were visa requirements, crime, and terrible infrastructure. I think the visa requirements have been lifted. On the plus side, their main language is Portuguese (did I mention I'm Brazilian?) and every Angolan I have ever met has been super cool.

**Johannesburg ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ ->** Popular surfing destination.

**Bali ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© ->** Very popular surfing destination.

**Sydney/Gold Coast ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º ->** Ultra popular surfing destinations.

**Polynesia ðŸ‡µðŸ‡« ->** Extremely popular surfing destination.

**Auckland ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ ->** Apparently the flights from here to Hawaii are cheaper, as if I needed an excuse to visit New Zealand.

**Oahu ðŸŒº ->** aka Paradise, another Ultra popular surfing destination. Currently my favorite place in the world, I wonder that opinion will have changed by the time I get there.

**California ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ->** Probably towards the South, San Diego or Santa Barbara. I will fly back home to New York from here Insha Allah.

My plan is to travel alone, meeting people and updating this blog. Notice that I did not include any time tables. Flight prices and level of fun will dictate my timing. 

### Logistics
â€”
Hereâ€™s what I have done so far:
I discussed my plans with a doctor during a routine physical exam. He gave me a tdap shot, a prescription for malaria pills, and suggested I take the polio and yellow fever vaccines. I might skip the polio and take the yellow fever shot as it is required in some countries in Africa and a good precaution.
I did a dentist checkup where I replaced an aging cracked filling.
I got a new travel credit card, the CapitalOne Venture X. [talk about itâ€¦ I have had and canceled most credit cards out there and do not qualify for the bonus. Luckily this one allowed me to do it and Iâ€™ll get 75k miles plus airport lounges etc.]
